# ALDM Diagrams (SVG)

## Purpose
This folder contains SVG diagram files for Application Logical Data Models (ALDM). These diagrams visually represent the structure, entities, and relationships of each ALDM, supporting clear communication and alignment across application layers.

## Contents
- **SVG diagrams**: Visual representations of ALDMs (e.g., `party-aldm.svg`, `party-aldm-uml-full.svg`)
- Each SVG should correspond to an ALDM model file in the parent folder

## Standards & Best Practices
- Use standard notations (Crow's Foot, UML) for all diagrams
- Include a legend and date in each SVG
- Name SVG files to match their corresponding ALDM (e.g., `party-aldm.svg`)
- Store only SVG files in this folder; source diagrams (e.g., VSDX) should be kept in the parent folder or a designated source folder
- Diagrams must be version-controlled and updated with model changes

## How to Use/Contribute
1. Add or update SVG diagrams when ALDMs change
2. Ensure diagrams are clear, complete, and use standard notation
3. Submit changes via pull request for review
