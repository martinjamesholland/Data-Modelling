\cf0 Can you output mapping documents in CVS format from CDM to ELDM to ALDM to BIM to all PDM, in relevant folders.\

I'll create CSV mapping documents that track relationships between different data model layers, following the data modeling standards. Let me first check the current project structure.\
Good news! The proper directory structure already exists. Let me examine each folder to see what models are currently available.\
Now let me read the content of the models to understand their structure and create appropriate mapping documents.\
Let me look at one of the ALDM files:\
Let me check the business information to understand the organization of the BIM:\
Now, let me check what Physical Data Models exist:\
Now I have a good understanding of the data models in the project. I'll create CSV mapping documents between the different layers of data models. Let's start by creating the mapping documents and place them in their relevant folders.\
First, let's create a CDM to ELDM mapping:\
Now, let's create an ELDM to ALDM mapping:\
Now, let's create an ALDM to BIM mapping:\
"\
Now, let's create a BIM to MongoDB PDM mapping:\
Now, let's create a BIM to API PDM mapping:\
Finally, let's create a BIM to Data Vault PDM mapping:\
I've successfully created CSV mapping documents for all the different data model layers:\
CDM to ELDM mapping: conceptual/cdm_to_eldm_mapping.csv\
ELDM to ALDM mapping: logical/enterprise/eldm_to_aldm_mapping.csv\
ALDM to BIM mapping: logical/application/aldm_to_bim_mapping.csv\
BIM to MongoDB PDM mapping: business/bim_to_mongodb_pdm_mapping.csv\
BIM to API PDM mapping: business/bim_to_api_pdm_mapping.csv\
BIM to Data Vault PDM mapping: physical/data_vault/bim_to_data_vault_pdm_mapping.csv\
Each mapping document follows the data modeling standards and includes the appropriate details for tracing how entities, attributes, and relationships transform between the different model layers. The files are placed in their respective folders according to the folder structure standards.}
