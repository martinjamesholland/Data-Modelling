Please now setup a data platform physical data vault 2.0 view from the ALDM, \
we need satellites that cover time series requirements, real time updates, daily updates data processing. please also set up a SVG image file of the hub, links and satellite tables of the data vault 2.0 view.\
This is for delta file format on Hadoop and GCP Big Query.\

I'll create a Data Vault 2.0 physical model based on the Party ALDM you've provided. Data Vault 2.0 is an excellent choice for time-series requirements and handling various update frequencies in your data platform.\
Let me first examine the structure and then create the necessary hub, link, and satellite tables for both Hadoop Delta format and GCP BigQuery.\
Let's check if there's already a structure in the data_vault directory:\
Now I'll create the Data Vault 2.0 model for your Party domain based on the ALDM. I'll start by setting up the SQL files for Delta file format on Hadoop and GCP BigQuery.\
First, let's define the Hub tables:\
Now, let's create the Hub for Person and Organization:\
Now, let's create some of the most important Link tables for our Data Vault 2.0 model:\
Now, let's create the Satellite tables. These are particularly important for your time-series requirements and will need to handle different update frequencies:\
Now, let's create an SVG image for the Data Vault 2.0 model to visualize the structure with hubs, links, and satellite tables:\
I've successfully created a comprehensive Data Vault 2.0 physical model for your Party domain based on the ALDM. This implementation includes:\
Hub tables for core business entities:\
hub_party, hub_person, hub_organization, etc.\
Link tables for relationships:\
link_party_person, link_party_organization, link_party_location, etc.\
Satellite tables for tracking attributes with time series support:\
sat_party, sat_person, sat_organization, etc.\
Each satellite includes history tracking, record versioning, and support for multiple update frequencies\
Support for multiple update frequencies:\
Real-time updates via streaming\
Daily batch updates\
Weekly/monthly updates\
Views for different access patterns:\
Current state views (*_current)\
Real-time update views (*_realtime)\
Daily batch views (*_daily)\
Platform-specific implementations:\
Delta format for Hadoop with appropriate partitioning\
GCP BigQuery with optimized clustering and partitioning\
SVG visualization of the Data Vault 2.0 model showing hubs, links, and satellites\
Comprehensive README with documentation\
This implementation follows Data Vault 2.0 best practices and provides the structure needed to handle your time-series requirements and multiple update frequencies while maintaining full historical tracking.\
For performance, are you able to split out the satellites, Where we have two so one is for timeseries and one is for current values?\
\
I'll create a satellite split model for better performance, separating time-series data from current values. This is a common Data Vault 2.0 pattern for optimizing query performance.\
I've implemented a split satellite model for your Data Vault 2.0 physical design, optimizing performance while maintaining all time-series capabilities. Here's what I've created:\
Split Satellite Approach:\
Current Satellites (sat_party_current.sql, sat_person_current.sql):\
Contain only the most recent record for each entity\
Optimized for fast operational queries (no partitioning, primary key on hub key)\
Minimal metadata for better performance\
Support for indexing on frequently queried columns\
History Satellites (sat_party_history.sql, sat_person_history.sql):\
Contain full historical data with time-series capabilities\
Partitioned by load date for efficient historical queries\
Complete metadata for effective dating and audit tracking\
All version history preserved\
Synchronization Mechanism (sat_sync_trigger.sql):\
Created procedures that keep current and history satellites in sync\
Scheduled to run at configurable intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes)\
Uses MERGE statements to efficiently update current satellites\
One-way sync (write once to history, read many from current)\
Performance-Optimized Views:\
Added aggregated daily views for common time-series patterns\
Maintained real-time views for streaming applications\
Created specialized views for different query patterns\
Visual Diagram (party_data_vault_split_model.svg):\
Shows the split satellite architecture with color coding\
Illustrates the synchronization flow between history and current satellites\
Includes performance benefits and data flow information\
This approach combines the best of both worlds:\
Fast query performance for operational needs (current satellites)\
Complete historical tracking for analytical and compliance needs (history satellites)\
Automated synchronization to keep both in sync\
Optimized for both Delta format on Hadoop and GCP BigQuery\
The split satellite pattern is a common Data Vault 2.0 optimization that dramatically improves query performance for operational systems while maintaining the full capabilities of time-series data modeling.}
