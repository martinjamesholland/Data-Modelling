# Request Logs

## Purpose
This folder contains documentation and logs related to data modeling requests, implementation steps, and project history. Request logs provide traceability, context, and rationale for modeling decisions and changes across the project lifecycle.

## Contents
- **Documentation files**: RTF or text files describing setup, mapping, and modeling processes (e.g., `1. Modelling Rule Setup.rtf`, `2. Setup CDM-ALDM-BIM-PDM-for_MDM_ODS.rtf`)
- Logs of modeling requests, decisions, and implementation steps

## Standards & Best Practices
- Use clear, descriptive filenames for all documentation
- Maintain chronological order and version history where possible
- Document the rationale and outcomes for all major modeling decisions
- All changes must undergo peer review and be version-controlled

## How to Use/Contribute
1. Add or update documentation files as new requests or changes occur
2. Ensure all logs are clear, complete, and provide necessary context
3. Submit changes via pull request for review and approval
