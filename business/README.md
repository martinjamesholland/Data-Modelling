# Business Information Models (BIM)

## Purpose
This folder contains Business Information Models (BIM), which provide the business glossary, glossary of terms, acceptable values, and business rules. BIM ensures clarity, consistency, and data quality by defining business concepts, terminology, and rules that underpin all data models.

## Contents
- **business_glossary.csv**: Glossary of business terms and definitions
- **acceptable_values.csv**: List of acceptable values for key business attributes
- **business_rules.csv**: Documented business rules and constraints
- **Mapping documents**: Files mapping BIM to other model layers (e.g., `bim_to_api_pdm_mapping.csv`, `bim_to_mongodb_pdm_mapping.csv`)

## Standards & Best Practices
- Use clear, descriptive, and consistent names for all terms and values
- Maintain up-to-date definitions and acceptable values
- Document business rules in a structured, reviewable format
- All changes must undergo peer review and be version-controlled

## How to Use/Contribute
1. Add or update glossary, values, or business rules as CSV files
2. Ensure all definitions and rules are clear and unambiguous
3. Update mapping documents as needed
4. Submit changes via pull request for review and approval
