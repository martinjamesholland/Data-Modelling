# MongoDB Physical Data Models

## Purpose
This folder contains physical data model artifacts specific to MongoDB implementations. These models define the structure, collections, and document schemas for storing data in MongoDB, aligned with the logical and business models.

## Contents
- **Schema files**: JSON or other formats defining MongoDB collections (e.g., `party-pdm-schema.json`)
- Mapping documents or scripts as needed

## Standards & Best Practices
- Use **lower_snake_case** for collection and field names
- Align MongoDB schemas with logical models and business requirements
- Document data retention, deletion, and security policies
- All changes must undergo peer review and be version-controlled

## How to Use/Contribute
1. Add or update MongoDB schema files
2. Ensure all schemas are consistent with logical models
3. Document any technology-specific implementation details
4. Submit changes via pull request for review and approval
