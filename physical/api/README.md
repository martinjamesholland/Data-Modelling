# API Physical Data Models

## Purpose
This folder contains physical data model artifacts for API contracts, such as OpenAPI/Swagger specifications. These models define the structure, endpoints, and data contracts for APIs, ensuring alignment with logical and business models.

## Contents
- **OpenAPI/Swagger files**: YAML or JSON specifications (e.g., `party-mdm-api-openapi.yaml`, `party-mdm-api-openapi-schemas.yaml`)
- Mapping documents or scripts as needed

## Standards & Best Practices
- Use **lower_snake_case** for endpoint and field names
- Ensure API contracts are consistent with logical and business models
- Document versioning, authentication, and security requirements
- All changes must undergo peer review and be version-controlled

## How to Use/Contribute
1. Add or update API specification files
2. Ensure all contracts are consistent with logical models
3. Document any technology-specific implementation details
4. Submit changes via pull request for review and approval
