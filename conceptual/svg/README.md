# CDM Diagrams (SVG)

## Purpose
This folder stores SVG diagram files for the Enterprise Conceptual Data Models (CDM). These diagrams visually represent the high-level entities and relationships defined in the CDM, supporting clear communication between business and technical stakeholders.

## Contents
- **SVG diagrams**: Visual representations of conceptual models (e.g., `party-cdm.svg`)
- Each SVG should correspond to a CDM JSON or mapping file in the parent folder

## Standards & Best Practices
- Use standard notations (Crow's Foot, UML) for all diagrams
- Include a legend and date in each SVG
- Name SVG files to match their corresponding CDM (e.g., `party-cdm.svg`)
- Store only SVG files in this folder; source diagrams (e.g., VSDX) should be kept in the parent folder or a designated source folder
- Diagrams must be version-controlled and updated with model changes

## How to Use/Contribute
1. Add or update SVG diagrams when conceptual models change
2. Ensure diagrams are clear, complete, and use standard notation
3. Submit changes via pull request for review
